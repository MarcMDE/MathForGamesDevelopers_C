# Math for Game Developers - C implementation with raylib
I implement the concepts learnt on "Math for Game Developers" videos (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW3Zl3wyJwWOpdhYedlD-yCB7WQoHf-My)
using C and raylib.

I decided to follow this videos and apply them on these small C programs
in order to learn some maths related with the videogames developement
since I need to improve this aspect of my formation.
