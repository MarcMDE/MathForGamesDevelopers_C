# Math for Game Developers - C implementation with raylib
I implement the concepts learnt on "Math for Game Developers" videos (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW3Zl3wyJwWOpdhYedlD-yCB7WQoHf-My)
using C and raylib.

I decided to follow this videos and apply them on these small C programs
in order to learn some maths related with the videogames developement
since I need to improve this aspect of my formation. 

# Playing the example
If you want to play the compiled example, you just need to download the
MFGD_X Folder and open the .exe (You basically need the .exe and openAl32.dll)

# Modifying/Compiling the source code
All the exemples were created using raylib. You can download it from www.raylib.com
